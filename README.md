# Jackalambda

[![Drone](https://drone.meltwater.io/api/badges/meltwater/jackalambda/status.svg?branch=master)](https://drone.meltwater.io/meltwater/jackalambda)

Mythical lambda creature.

## Description

Toolkit for writing production ready Lambda functions.

Jackalambda provides a consistent way to write Lambda handlers
that let you focus on the business logic of you function and none of the boilerplate.

With Jackalambda, you get:

- Consistent [JSON logging][@meltwater/mlabs-logger].
- [Cached remote secrets and configuration][@meltwater/aws-configuration-fetcher].
- AWS event detection and parsing.
- X-Ray enhanced clients for common AWS services.
- Distributed request id support.
- Isolated side effects for fully testable handlers.
- [AVA] logging integration.

All Jackalambda handlers follow a clear execution path:

1. Resolve and validate all required configuration, or fail with a clear error.
2. Isolate all side-effect producing dependencies in a container with their configuration.
3. Run a processor function with a reference to the container.
4. Ensure the logger is always available, scoped per-request, and always logs failures,
   event fatal ones.

### Example

_This project is a fully working,
real world, example of using Jackalambda.
Just check out the `handlers` folder._

Creating your first handler is this simple:

```js
import { createHandler } from '@meltwater/jackalambda'

export handler = createHandler({
  createProcessor: ({ log }) => (event, context) => {
    log.info({ meta: event }, 'I ðŸ’– Jackalambda')
    return { success: true }
  }
})
```

And here is how to add a side-effect that calls another lambda
where the lambda ARN is stored in SSM:

```js
import { createHandler, LambdaClient } from '@meltwater/jackalambda'
import { createSsmStringConfigurationRequest } from '@meltwater/aws-configuration-fetcher'

export handler = createHandler({
  configurationRequests: [
    createSsmStringConfigurationRequest(
      'otherLambdaArn',
      process.env.OTHER_LAMBDA_ARN_SSM_PATH
    )
  ],
  createContainer: (ctx, { otherLambdaArn }) => ({
    otherLambdaClient: new LambdaClient({ arn: otherLambdaArn, ...ctx })
  }),
  createProcessor: ({ log }, { otherLambdaClient }) => (event, context) => {
    log.info({ meta: event }, 'I ðŸ’– Jackalambda')
    return otherLambdaClient.invokeJson(event)
  }
})
```

```

Primary development tasks are defined under `scripts` in `package.json`
and available via `yarn run`.
View them with

```
$ yarn run
```

### Source code

The [source code] is hosted on GitHub.
Clone the project with

```
$ git clone git@github.com:meltwater/jackalambda.git
```

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm], [Yarn], and a [Node.js debugging] client.

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Install the development dependencies with

```
$ yarn install
```

#### Drone

_Drone should already be configured: this section is for reference only._

The following secrets must be set on [Drone].
These may be set manually or by running the script `./.drone/secrets.sh`.

Note the Drone config path must be set to `.drone/config.yml`
after the repo is activated.

##### npm

- `npm_token_ro`: npm token for installing packages.
- `npm_token_rw`: npm token for publishing packages.
- `npm_team`: npm team to grant read-only package access
  (format `org:team`, optional).

##### Slack

- `slack_webhook`: Slack webhook for build notifications.

##### Drone Promotion

When the drone build publishes a new package version it can trigger
a promotion event on a Drone repo.

- `drone_server`: Drone server.
- `drone_token`: Drone token.

##### AWS S3 Release

- `aws_assume_role_arn_staging`: The AWS role to assume for staging.
- `aws_assume_role_external_id_staging`: The external ID for the AWS role for staging.
- `aws_assume_role_arn_production`: The AWS role to assume for production.
- `aws_assume_role_external_id_production`: The external ID for the AWS role for production.

### Publishing

Use the [`npm version`][npm-version] command to release a new version.
This will push a new git tag which will trigger a CI publish job.

[npm-version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version
